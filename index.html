								<b>Research Interests:</b> <br>
								I’m interested in studying the evolution of galaxies and the dark matter haloes in which they reside. 
								Many aspects of dark matter haloes are still not well understood. In particular through the use of N-body 
								simulations I’ve studied what it means to have a “Milky Way-like” dark matter halo, how dark matter halo 
								properties correlate with subhalo abundances, and what dark matter halo density profiles look like without 
								their subhaloes. Because we reside within the Milky Way we have a much more limited understanding of its 
								history and evolution. I have spent time with the SDSS-IV Milky Way as a galaxy group on determining photometric 
								properties of the Milky Way using machine learning in order to better determine the Milky Way’s color and 
								luminosity which provide insight into its evolution.

								<b>Dark Substructure of the Milky Way</b><br> 
								One of the unique predictions of LCDM are the abundant dark matter subhaloes. They 
								cause detectable perturbations which can constrain halo properties and test the validity of 
								LCDM. However, there are well known discrepancies at smaller scales (<1 Mpc/h) in which 
								observations do not match what cold dark matter simulations predict. One such issue is the 
								"missing satellites problem", where the predicted satellite abundance for a halo of the mass 
								of the Milky Way is much larger than the number of satellites observed around the Milky Way. 
								In light of this, with high resolution zoom-in simulations of Milky Way mass dark matter haloes 
								I investigated halo properties beyond mass and their correlation with subhalo abundance in order 
								to determine subhalo populations for a halo whose properties match our own. Predicting the subhalo 
								mass function from a DM-only simulation that matches the Milky Way in mass only and not in 
								other important second order parameters such as concentration, spin, and time of the last major merger, 
								has resulted in the missing satellites problem (partially). Simulators attempt to fix this problem by 
								tuning baryonic physics in hydrodynamical simulations to reduce the number of observed satellites. However, 
								we need to batter match what we already know about the Milky Way halo. I constructed a Poisson maximum likelihood 
								model to make a more accurate prediction for the Milky Way's subhalo abundance, resulting in the conclusion 
								that the Milky Way has as many as 30-50\% fewer subhaloes than another halo of the same mass <br></br>

								<b>Towards a More Universal Density Profile: Halo Mass Distributions Without Subhaloes</b><br>
								Comparing dark matter halo simulations and observations necessitates comparisons of the same thing. However,
								while dark matter halo simulations include the set of the host and subhaloes, observations that model dark matter
								haloes typically attribute another mass distribution to the substructure in addition to the observed ensemble. Thus there
								is a double-counting problem. I investigate dark matter halo mass distributions with and without the 
								presence of subhaloes, finding that not only are these two substaintially differet, but that both mass distributions
								are well described by a generalised Einasto profile.<br></br>

								<b>The Milky Way As A Galaxy Working Group</b><br>
								As a member of this SDSS-IV working group I've been involved with a number of aspects in regards to the study of the
								Milky Way. The focus of my work as been on the selection of Milky Way Analogs (see me GitHub link) and using machine 
								learning to predict various Milky Way properties as they would be if we were an external observer. An upcoming goal is
								the creation of a SED for the Milky Way.

								<b>Milky Way Analog Selection:</b> <br>
								<a href="https://github.com/cfielder/Milky-Way-Analogs">Link to Github repository for selecting Milky Way analogs</a> <br>
								This code is designed for efficient selection and analysis of Milky Way analogs. Analogs
								are selected by random draws from the fiducial Milky Way PDF in the parameter space of interest.
								More than three parameters are discouraged due to small numbers of analogs. For each set of random 
								draws the nearest neighbors are found in a binary tree. Then the sample's photometric properties, 
								derivatives of the photometric properties, and the errors + Eddington bias are calculated.

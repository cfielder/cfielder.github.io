								I am a graduate student afiliated with the University of Pittsburgh, department of 
								<a href="https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu" target="_blank">Physics and Astronomy</a>.<br><br>
							
								Iâ€™m interested in studying the evolution of galaxies and the dark matter haloes in which they reside, particularly 
								at the mass range of the Milky Way. While the Milky Way offers a unique perspective to study nuanced details of galaxy formation,
								we still have a very limited ability to compare the Milky Way to other galaxies. My 
								<a href="https://cfielder.github.io/#research" target="_blank">research</a> aims to close this gap. <br><br>
								I participate heavily in the <a href="https://www.sdss.org" target="_blank">SDSS-IV</a> Milky Way as a Galaxy group. <br><br>
								
								I am passionate about inclusion and equity both in an out of academia. I am a member of the
								<a href="https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/women-and-minorities-physics-pitt" target="_blank"> Women and Minorities in Physics </a>

								My research focuses on the intersection of interpreting theoretical frameworks that originate from dark matter 
								simulations and improved observational constraints, particularly in the mass range of the Milky Way. My experience 
								with this diverse set of observed and simulated datasets illuminates the discrepancies in existing models which 
								places me in a unique position with which I can bridge the gap between observational constrains and simulations 
								predictions. Specifically, I aim to prune simulation datasets for a more accurate representation of our Galaxy and 
								to utilize the observation data at our disposal to constrain the physical processes of galaxy formation. <br>
								Below I outline my research interests and relevant papers.

								<b>Milky Way Analog Selection:</b> <br>
								<a href="https://github.com/cfielder/Milky-Way-Analogs">Github repository for selecting Milky Way analogs</a> <br>
								This code is designed for efficient selection and analysis of Milky Way analogs. Analogs
								are selected by random draws from the fiducial Milky Way PDF in the parameter space of interest.
								More than three parameters are discouraged due to small numbers of analogs. For each set of random 
								draws the nearest neighbors are found in a binary tree. Then the sample's photometric properties, 
								derivatives of the photometric properties, and the errors + Eddington bias are calculated.<br>
								This code is useful for anyone interested in selecticting Milky Way, Andromeda, etc. analog galaxies.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Useful Catalogs:</b>
								Links to catalogs with which to study Milky Way analogs will be included shortly.

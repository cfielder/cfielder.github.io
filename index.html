								<b>Research Interests:</b> <br>
								I’m interested in studying the evolution of galaxies and the dark matter haloes in which they reside. 
								Many aspects of dark matter haloes are still not well understood. In particular through the use of N-body 
								simulations I’ve studied what it means to have a “Milky Way-like” dark matter halo, how dark matter halo 
								properties correlate with subhalo abundances, and what dark matter halo density profiles look like without 
								their subhaloes. Because we reside within the Milky Way we have a much more limited understanding of its 
								history and evolution. I have spent time with the SDSS-IV Milky Way as a galaxy group on determining photometric 
								properties of the Milky Way using machine learning in order to better determine the Milky Way’s color and 
								luminosity which provide insight into its evolution.

								<b>Predictably Missing Satellites: Subhalo Abundances in Milky Way-like Dark Matter Haloes</b><br> 
								In this project I investigated the 'missing satellites problem' in the context of Milky Way-like dark matter heales,
								i.e. haloes that are similar to the Milky Way in properties other than mass such as concentration, spin, shape, and
								merger history. We find that a halo most like the Milky Way has as many as 30-50% fewer subhaloes than another halo of the 
								same mass. Models that are tuned to explain the missing satellites problem are thus likely over-correcting for the
								supression of satellite formation. <br></br>

								<b>Towards a More Universal Density Profile: Halo Mass Distributions Without Subhaloes</b><br>
								Comparing dark matter halo simulations and observations necessitates comparisons of the same thing. However,
								while dark matter halo simulations include the set of the host and subhaloes, observations that model dark matter
								haloes typically attribute another mass distribution to the substructure in addition to the observed ensemble. Thus there
								is a double-counting problem. I investigate dark matter halo mass distributions with and without the 
								presence of subhaloes, finding that not only are these two substaintially differet, but that both mass distributions
								are well described by a generalised Einasto profile.<br></br>

								<b>The Milky Way As A Galaxy Working Group</b><br>
								As a member of this SDSS-IV working group I've been involved with a number of aspects in regards to the study of the
								Milky Way. The focus of my work as been on the selection of Milky Way Analogs (see me GitHub link) and using machine 
								learning to predict various Milky Way properties as they would be if we were an external observer. An upcoming goal is
								the creation of a SED for the Milky Way.

								<b>Milky Way Analog Selection:</b> <br>
								<a href="https://github.com/cfielder/Milky-Way-Analogs">Link to Github repository for selecting Milky Way analogs</a> <br>
								This code is designed for efficient selection and analysis of Milky Way analogs. Analogs
								are selected by random draws from the fiducial Milky Way PDF in the parameter space of interest.
								More than three parameters are discouraged due to small numbers of analogs. For each set of random 
								draws the nearest neighbors are found in a binary tree. Then the sample's photometric properties, 
								derivatives of the photometric properties, and the errors + Eddington bias are calculated.
